# AdventOfCode2024

To run a solution:

```sh
$ iex -S mix
```

```elixir
AdventOfCode2024.run(1) # <= day
# {:ok, 22_588_371}
```

Each day challenge has 2 parts, so for each part, we have a specific commit and tag,
that you can use to execute the specific day/part you want, like:

```sh
$ git checkout day_1_1st_solution
```

```elixir
AdventOfCode2024.run(1) # <= day
# {:ok, 1_590_491}
```
